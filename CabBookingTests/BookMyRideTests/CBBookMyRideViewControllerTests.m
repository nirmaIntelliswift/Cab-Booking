 - http request get my all cabs and got success
 - check view footer height in setViewFooter funcation by mock object

 - mapMovement providing destinationLocation  and current location as mock object
 - opening search controller 
 - map location address

 what this viewController do?
 - shows current location
 - on dragging change pickup/destination location
 - choose destination place from search and update map accordingly
 - move map to  pick up and destination location on tapping
 -
 - cab category listing
 - cab category selection update cabs on map
 
 - cab placement update after 5 sec
